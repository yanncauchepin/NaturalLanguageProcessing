"""Naive Bayes algorithm:
P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)
To get around this problem, we use Naive Bayes, which assumes that all the features 
are independent of each other, so the joint probability is simply the product of 
independent probabilities. This assumption is naive because it is almost always wrong.
